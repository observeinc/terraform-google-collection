# Application Administration

As a Django administrator, I want to: 

 * [log into the Django Admin.](login-django-admin.md)
 * [update the product listing.](update-product-listing.md)
 * [change the look and feel of the website.](update-site-config.md)
 * [apply database migrations](apply-migrations.md)


*Want more options? [Request some new docs!](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/avocano/issues/new/choose)*
