# Update site config

Once you have [logged into the admin](login-django-admin.md), you can update the site's look and feel by going to the "Store > Site Config" page. 

There will be one existing active site configuration that you can edit, or you can create a new configuration. 

You have the ability to adjust: 

  * The base font used on the website. 
    * You can choose any font available in Google Fonts. Click the help text on the field for the full list.
  * The font and colour of the website heading.
  * Several colours used for banners, headings, and buttons on the site.
