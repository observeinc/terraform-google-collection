# Viewing products

*Descriptions presume a default deployment, with supplied demo data. Adjust if you have [customised](../django/update-product-listing.md) your setup.*


Head on over to your website (`PROJECTID.web.app`) and you will see a "Sparkly Avocado" available for purchase for a price. 

Click on the "Products" tab, (`PROJECTID.web.app/products`), and you'll see other products available, including a Pineapple Bee, Wooden Tiger, and Star Unicorn. 

# "Purchasing" Products

If on any product listing you click "Buy", you'll be told "Oops! Sorry! This is not a real product."

**This is expected**. This application isn't designed as a full retail store, merely an "April's Fools Day" "fake product" listing site. 

Yes, we wish there were such things as Sparkly Avocados, too.
