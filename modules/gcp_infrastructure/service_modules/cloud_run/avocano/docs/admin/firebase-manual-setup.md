# Setup Firebase Manually

As an alternative to running `firebase projects:addfirebase`, you can setup Firebase manually through the Firebase Console. 

* In a new tab, open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
* Click on the "Create Project" button
    * Note: If you have previously created a Firebase project, this button will read "+ Add Project".
* Click on the "Enter your project name" field, and wait for the dropdown to populate with a list of your existing projects.
* Select the project you created earlier, and click **Continue**.
* Confirm the Firebase billing plan by clicking **Confirm plan**.
* Read the information about connecting Google Cloud and Firebase projects, and click **Continue**.
* Click the toggle to disable Google Analytics, and click **Add Firebase**. 
* In the confirmation screen, click **Continue**.
